For enjoying the game, just running the "untitled2.exe" file.



## Key operation

- **Move up, down, left and right**:
  - `W`, `S`, `A`, `D`
  - Or use the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →)

- **Select**:
  - `Spacebar` (Space)

- **Undo the previous step**:
  - `L`
  - **Note**: Continuous undo operations are not allowed

- **Existing cards shuffled and reshuffled**:
  - `K`

- **Remove a card from the card slot**:
  - `J`
  - **Note**: A maximum of 9 cards can be taken out. If more than this number is exceeded, the game will be judged as failed.

- **Exit game or restart**:
  - `P`
  
  

## Innovation point
1. **Difficulty Settings**: Provides ten different difficulty levels from 1 to 10.
2. **Randomness**: Each layer of cards is completely random, and the superposition between layers is also random.



## Development thoughts
As a newcomer who has never been exposed to programming before college, writing a game by myself for the first time feels very fulfilling!
